# Drug_Sideeffect_classification_model

healthcare provides value-based care to millions across the globe. With the help of machine learning (ML), healthcare professionals can now utilize real-time patient data to improve the efficacy of treatment options.
Side effects refer to the undesirable secondary effects that occur beside the desired therapeutic effect of a drug or medication.Side effects may vary across individuals depending on their disease state, weight, gender, ethnicity, and general health. 

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify drug side effects based on age, gender, and race.
The model analyses a large dataset of patient records and drug side effect of size 400000 with the help of 3 different machine learning algorithms.
